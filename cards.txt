1.1
Write a failing integration test that loads map.csv, 
routes according to time from New York, 
and compares the result to the route in times.csv.
Fill in the compile errors with null code.

1.2
Use unit tests to drive code that reads in
map.csv-format time data and converts it into a
convenient data structure in memory for
traversing.

1.3
Use unit tests to drive code that can find
the route through a map with only two locations
and one route leg, but that is perplexed by a
more complicated map.

1.4
Design a four-location map with six route legs
where one route takes less time than the other, and
drive out code that always finds the least-time
route.  Never visit a location more than once.

1.5
Turn your code loose in New York and make sure it
finds a complete 22-city tour.  Make the integration
test pass, even if you have to change the asserts.

2.1
Write another integration test that starts in Atlanta.
Make sure your code gracefully handles an impossibility.
Make the integration test pass.

3.1
Write another integration test starting in New York,
but this time assert on the route from distances.csv.
Restructure your code so that you can tell it to
operate on time or distance, but put only null code
on the distance side to keep the test failing.

3.2
Use unit tests to drive the code that will make the
new integration test pass--again, even if you have
to change the assert, as long as you have a 22-city
tour.

4.1
Modify your Atlanta integration test by replacing its
assertions.  Assert the route starting in Miami, but
prefix it with Atlanta--so that it visits Atlanta twice.
Assert the cost of the Miami route plus the cost of
the Atlanta-to-Miami leg.

4.2
Use unit tests, where necessary, to drive modifications
to allow multiple visits.  See if you can get the Atlanta
route to calculate in the time you have remaining in
the cycle.
